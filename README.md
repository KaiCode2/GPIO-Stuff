# GPIO-Stuff

A fun place for me to save and share my GPIO code. Enjoy!


### Notes
- All the code in this repo is run on my raspberry pi (B+) and connected to a BreadBoard via. GPIO.
- As of now, all the code is written in [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) and will utilize the [GPIO framework](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO) quite often.
